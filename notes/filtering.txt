    Filtering:
- Filter recipes by ingredients/tags
    • Find certain types of recipes
- Filter tags/ingredients by assigned
    • List filter options for recipes
- Define OpenAPI parameters
    • Update documentation


    Example requests:
- Filter recipes by tag(s):
    • GET /api/recipe/recipes/?tags=1,2,3
    • ?tags=... is a query parameter
- Filter recipes by ingredient(s):
    • GET /api/recipe/recipes/?ingredient=1,2,3

- Filter tags by assigned only:
    • GET /api/recipe/tags/?assigned_only=1
    • Only show tags that are assigned to some recipe
- Filter ingredients by assigned only:
    • GET /api/recipe/ingredients/?assigned_only=1
    • Only show ingredients that are assigned to some recipe


    OpenAPI Schema:
- Auto generated Schema
- Some things need to be manually configured
    • Custom query params (filtering)
- Use DRf Spectacular extended_schema_view decorator
