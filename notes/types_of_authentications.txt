    TYPES OF AUTHENTICATION
- Basic:
Send username and password with each request.
(BAD)

- Token:
Use a token in the HTTP header

- JSON Web Token (JWT):
Use an access and refresh token.
Advanced and only used in massive websites (millions of users).

- Session:
Use cookies


Token Authentication:
- Balance of simplicity and security.
- Supportted out of the box by DRF.
- Well supported by most clients.

How it works:
- Create token (Post username/pass)
- Store token on client (session storage, local storage, cookie, db)
- Include token in HTTP headers.

Logging out:
 - Happens on the client side
 - Delete token

 Why no logout API? (like the login API that creates a token)
 - Unreliable.
 - E.g.: user uninstalls app, it's not able to call logout so you don't notice.
 User disconnects from internet or clear session.
 - Not useful.
