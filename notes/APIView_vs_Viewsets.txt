What is a view?

- Handles a request made to a URL
- Django uses functions
- DRF uses classes
    · Reusable logic
    · Override behaviour
- DRF also supports decorators
- APIView and Viewsets = DRF base classes


    APIView:
- Focused around HTTP methods
- Class methods for HTTP methods
    · GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
- Provide flexibility over URLs and logic
- Useful for non CRUD APIs
    · Avoid for simple Create, Read, Update, Delete APIs
    · Bespoke logic (e.g.: auth, jobs, external apis)
    · Basically anything that doesn't map to a specific model
    in your system, it might be better to think about using an APIView


    Viewsets:
- Focused around actions
    · Retrieve, list, update, partial update, destroy
- Map to Django models
- Use Routers to generate URLs
- Great for CRUD operations on models
